## Purpose
This project will investigate the role of Image Explorer for helping with exploring images by blind
and visually impaired individuals. We developed a mobile application where you upload an
image of interest and are then able to understand the contents of the image through summary
and a touch-based interface. We would like to understand how Image Explorer helps in
exploring images.
